## 📌 Key Recommendations 

### **Finance**
- Prioritize investment in top revenue drivers (**27" 4K Monitor, PS5 Bundle, Nintendo Switch, Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3**) to recover revenue lost after the Jan 2021 decline.
- Use **seasonality-based forecasting**, since revenue consistently peaks in **Nov–Jan** and drops afterwards.

### **Sales**
- Implement **region-specific strategies**, focusing on **EU & APAC**, which faced the steepest decline, while leveraging successful **NA** tactics.
- **Revive the Direct Sales channel** through product bundles, loyalty rewards, and stronger reseller partnerships.

### **Marketing**
- Shift more budget toward **Social Media & Affiliate Marketing**, which demonstrated growth vs. declining Direct/Email performance.
- Launch targeted campaigns for underperforming products (**Nintendo Switch, 27" 4K Monitor, JBL Quantum 100**) aligned with seasonal demand.

---

### 🧠 **Summary Insight**
The revenue decline is closely associated with falling purchase volume of key products and weakened direct marketing performance across multiple regions. Focused investment, regional strategy adjustments, and optimized marketing channels offer the strongest path to accelerating revenue recovery.
